We won our pick of the week for the second time in as many tries this season, with the Dolphins and Chiefs getting us home (despite, for the second straight week, one of the teams not covering their unteased line).",

Instead, the Falcons got it to an onside kick situation (about a 98% chance to win) and treated it like a bunt down the third base line that they were waiting to go foul.",

If Matt Ryan produces his season averages in Week 3 (361.5 yards and three touchdowns) against the Bears at home, it will be very difficult for Mitchell Trubisky and the Bears to keep up, even against a defense as bad as Atlanta’s.",
